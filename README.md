# ELECTRON-MITHRIL-BOILERPLATE
This is an attempt at a boilerplate to create an app using [mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) and [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). It is based off of [create-mithril-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mithril-app).

## Setup
Clone or download this repository.

```bash
cd electron-mithril-boilerplate
```

Install node modules using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#windows-stable) (follow the link to download and install yarn if you do not already have it installed).

```bash
yarn
```

## Run
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Edit
Begin by editing MainView.js in the client folder. You should be able to see changes automatically in your app.

## Build Distributable Setup Files
```bash
yarn build
```
